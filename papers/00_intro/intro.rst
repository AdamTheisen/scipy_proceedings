SciPy 2015, the fourteenth annual Scientific Computing with Python
conference, was held July 6 |--| 12th in Austin, Texas. This community, focused
on the use and development of open source scientific software in Python, has
grown enormously since its origins at the first SciPy conference in 2002 at the
California Institute of Technology. This growth is due in no small part to the
enormous growth in support from industrial, government, and academic partners.
The success of this community is a testament to the individual
attendees, whether returning for their 14th year or attending for the
first time, who provide the science, enthusiasm, and inspiration on
which the community thrives.

|noindent|
The conference this year consisted of two days of tutorials by followed by
three days of presentations and concluded with two days of developer sprints on
projects of interest to attendees. The topics covered in those days spanned a
wide array of domains and attracted attendees from across the globe. In
particular, the two central themes this year emphasized Python use within
Quantitative Finance and Computational Social Sciences and the emergent
area of Data Science. The conference minisymposia also attracted exceptional
representation from the scientific disciplines highlighted in those additional
domain-specific tracks :

- Astronomy and Astrophysics
- Geospatial Information Sciences
- Geophysics
- Oceanography and Meteorology
- Computational Life and Medical Sciences
- Vision, Visualization, and Imaging
- Engineering

|noindent|
This year, we were privileged to have three prominent community members present
keynote talks. Chris Wiggins, a professor at Columbia University and the Chief
Data Scientist at the New York Times, gave a unique perspective on the data
science behind the business of the newspaper industry. Pandas developer and
author, Wes McKinney, then told his story of a career path through mathematics,
finance and tech startups. Finally, the director of research at the University
of Washington's eScience Institute and core contributor to a number of
scientific Python libraries, Jake Vanderplas, gave a motivating perspective on
the interface between science and data.

|noindent|
The conference continues to grow with over 600 participants from
**howmany** countries, **newfrac** percent of whom were attending
SciPy for the first time. More than half of attendees are now from
industry, the rest split between government laboratories and the
academy.  This year's record conference attendance as well as record
participation in the tutorials (over 300 people) and in the sprints
(over 200) are indicative of the increasing global interest
surrounding scientific python. Tool development,
which now moves at a blinding pace in this community, is accordingly converging
on remarkable advances in visualization, data analysis, domain science, and
quantitative social sciences - all represented at this conference.  The
organizing committee is dedicated to increasing representation from
underrepresented groups. In addition to organizing a luncheon focused on
diversity, the Diversity Committee awarded 5 scholarships, sponsored by
NumFOCUS, which were focused on improving the representation of women,
minorities, and disabled populations in our community. Including those, our
many sponsors awarded funding to help 31 people attend the conference.

|noindent|
Fourteen Birds of a Feather sessions were organized around various topics, providing an
effective platform for discussing issues relevant to the community.  New open
space activities, sponsor-funded social events and tutorials effectively
exposed newcomers to the welcoming and inclusive scientific Python community.

|noindent|
These proceedings contain 30 peer-reviewed contributions, based on talks and
posters presented at the conference.  This cross-section of the talks and
posters presented at the conference represents a detailed window into the
motivations, processes, and science behind the tools, technologies, and
applications that drive this community.  We hope you'll enjoy the effort of the
authors, the contributions of the reviewers, and the window into the community
represented by these papers. These proceedings, led by updated guidance
introduced by the organizers represent an effort by the organizers and authors
to emphasize transparency and clarity of these words across the boundaries of
scientific disciplines.
