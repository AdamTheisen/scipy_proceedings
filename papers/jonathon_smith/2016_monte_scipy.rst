MONTE Python for Deep Space Navigation
--------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

The Mission Analysis, Operations, and Navigation Toolkit Environment
(MONTE) is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) signature astrodynamic
computing platform. It was built to support JPL's deep space exploration
program, and has been used to fly robotic spacecraft to Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Ceres, and many solar system small bodies. At its core, MONTE
consists of low-level astrodynamic libraries that are written in C++
and presented to the end user as an importable Python language module.
These libraries form the basis on which Python-language applications
are built for specific astrodynamic applications, like trajectory
design and optimization, orbit determination, flight path control, and
more. This paper gives a brief history of the project, shows some
examples of MONTE in action, and relates the stories of its greatest
successes.

NOTE FOR REVIEWERS
------------------

I have a full draft paper prepared, but it is still making its way
through JPL document review. As soon as I get final approval (either
Tuesday, May 31, or Wednesday, June 1) I will update this version with
the full copy. Thanks for your patience.
