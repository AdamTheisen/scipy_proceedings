Solving Polynomial Systems with phcpy
-------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   The solutions of a system of polynomials in several variables are often 
   needed, e.g.: in the design of mechanical systems, and 
   in phase-space analyses of nonlinear biological dynamics. 
   Reliable, accurate, and comprehensive numerical solutions are available 
   through PHCpack, a FOSS package for solving polynomial systems with 
   homotopy continuation.

   This paper explores the development of phcpy, a scripting interface for 
   PHCpack, over the past five years. One result is the availability of phcpy
   through a JupyterHub featuring Python2, Python3, and SageMath kernels.

Introduction
------------

Although phcpy is only a couple of years out,
three instances in the research literature mention its application
in the computation of the following:

* The number of embeddings of minimally rigid graphs [BELT18]_.

* Roots of Alexander polynomials [CD18]_.

* Critical points of equilibrium problems [SWM16]_ .

The cited publications above appear respectively in symbolic computation,
geometry and topology, chemical engineering.
