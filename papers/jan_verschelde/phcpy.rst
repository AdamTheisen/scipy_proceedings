Solving Polynomial Systems with phcpy
-------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   The solutions of a system of polynomials in several variables are often 
   needed, e.g.: in the design of mechanical systems, and 
   in phase-space analyses of nonlinear biological dynamics. 
   Reliable, accurate, and comprehensive numerical solutions are available 
   through PHCpack, a FOSS package for solving polynomial systems with 
   homotopy continuation.

   This paper explores the development of phcpy, a scripting interface for 
   PHCpack, over the past five years. One result is the availability of phcpy
   through a JupyterHub featuring Python2, Python3, and SageMath kernels.

Introduction
------------

The Python package phcpy [Ver14]_ provides an alternative to the
command line executable ``phc`` of PHCpack [Ver99]_ to solve polynomial systems
by homotopy continuation methods.  
Scripts replace command line options and text menus.
Data remains persistent in a session, decreasing the dependency on files.

The meaning of *solving* evolved from computing approximations to
all isolated solution into the numerical irreducible decomposition
of the solution set.  The numerical irreducible decomposition includes
not only the isolated solutions, but also representations for all
positive dimensional solution sets.  Such representations consist
of sets of *generic points*, partitioned along the irreducible factors.
Polynomial homotopy continuation is at the origin of many of the algorithms
in numerical algebraic geometry [SVW05]_.
Parallel versions of the software described in [SVW03]_
were recently developed [Ver18]_ and added to phcpy.

The focus of this paper is on the application of new technology
to solve polynomial systems, in particular, cloud computing [BSVY15]_
and multicore shared memory parallelism
accelerated with graphics processing units [VY15]_.
Our web interface offers phcpy in a SageMath [Sage]_, [SJ05]_ kernel
or in a Python kernel of a Jupyter notebook [Klu16]_.

Although phcpy is only a couple of years out,
three instances in the research literature mention its application
in the computation of the following:

* The number of embeddings of minimally rigid graphs [BELT18]_.

* Roots of Alexander polynomials [CD18]_.

* Critical points of equilibrium problems [SWM16]_ .

The cited publications above appear respectively in symbolic computation,
geometry and topology, chemical engineering.

Mechanism Design
----------------

Fig. :ref:`fig4barcoupler` illustration a reproduction
of a result in the mechanism design literature [MW90]_.
Given five points, the problem is to determine the length of two bars
so their coupler curve passes through the five given points.

.. figure:: ./fbarcoupler.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: h

   The design of a 4-bar mechanism.  :label:`fig4barcoupler`

This example is part of the tutorial of phcpy and the scripts 
to reproduce the results are in its source code distribution.
The equations are generated with sympy [SymPy]_
and the plots are made with matplotlib [Hun07]_.

Mission and Realization
-----------------------

The mission of phcpy is to bring Polynomial Homotopy Continuation
into Python's computational ecosystem.
The realization of phcpy happens by wrapping the compiled code
provided as shared object files by PHCpack.
This approach has two benefits.
First, the wrapping transfers the implementation of the many
available homotopy algorithms in a direct way into Python modules.
Second, we do not sacrifice the efficiency of the compiled code.
Scripts replace the input/output movements and interactions with
the user, but not the computationally intensive algorithms.

Code Snippets
-------------

Code snippets suggest typical applications and guide novice user.

The screen shot in Fig. :ref:`figsnippet` shows the code snippet
with an example of use of the blackbox solver.

.. figure:: ./bbsolvesnippet2.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: h

   The code snippet for the blackbox solver.  :label:`figsnippet`

CGI Scripting
-------------

In our first design of a web interface to ``phc``,
we developed a collection of Python scripts,
following common programming patterns [Chu06]_.
Below is a listing of the key ingredients in our first web interface.

1. Posting and processing of HTML forms:

   * pure Python code prints the HTML code; and 

   * the input of the forms is processed with Python functions.

2. MySLQdb does the management of user data:

   * names and encrypted passwords,

   * generic, random folder names to store data files,

   * file names with polynomial systems solved.

3. With the module smtplib we define email exchanges:

   * automatic 2-step registration process,

   * automatic password recovery protocol.

Jupyter and JupyterHub
----------------------

The Jupyter notebook supports language agnostic computations,
supporting execution environments in several dozen languages.
With JupyterHub, we can run the code in a Python Terminal session,
in a Jupyter notebook running Python, or in a SageMath session.

For the user administration, we recycled our first web interface.

With JupyterHub, we provide user accounts on our server.

* At login time, a new process is spawned.

* Users have generic, random login names.

* Actions of users must be isolated from each other.

The setup requires some system administration expertise.
