	abstract = {State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to reﬁne the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classiﬁcation tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train.},

	abstract = {The structure-from-motion problem is traditionally addressed by establishing point correspondences and then applying classic geometry techniques. However, depending on the application, perhaps only partial scene reconstruction is necessary. In such cases, computing the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential invariants of image motion, namely divergence, curl, and deformation, can directly provide information about scene structure, while avoiding complex projective geometry. Even though divergence, curl, and deformation have been shown to be useful for partial scene reconstruction, little work has been done to extract these quantities from image sequences. In this paper we propose a way to extract the diﬀerential invariants of image motion from an optical ﬂow ﬁeld using a bank of ﬁlters. The output of these ﬁlters can later be used for the recovery of surface normals and time-to-contact.},

	abstract = {Cilia are hairlike structures protruding from nearly every cell in the body. Diseases known as ciliopathies, where cilia function is disrupted, can result in a wide spectrum of disorders. However, most techniques for assessing ciliary motion rely on manual identification and tracking of cilia; this process is laborious and error-prone, and does not scale well. Even where automated ciliary motion analysis tools exist, their applicability is limited. Here, we propose an end-to-end computational machine learning pipeline that automatically identifies regions of cilia from videos, extracts patches of cilia, and classifies patients as exhibiting normal or abnormal ciliary motion. In particular, we demonstrate how convolutional LSTM are able to encode complex features while remaining sensitive enough to differentiate between a variety of motion patterns. Our framework achieves 90\% with only a few hundred training epochs. We find that the combination of segmentation and classification networks in a single pipeline yields performance comparable to existing computational pipelines, while providing the additional benefit of an end-to-end, fully-automated analysis toolbox for ciliary motion.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

A second conshaint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocify of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. 77te algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitiveto quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image.},

	abstract = {Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a disorder characterized by sinopulmonary disease arising from ciliary motion defects in respiratory epithelia. An essential ﬁrst step in the diagnostic evaluation of PCD is the use of high-speed videomicroscopy to analyze ciliary beat patterns in nasal epithelia biopsies. This includes a quantitative assessment of ciliary beat frequency (CBF, where CBF of {\textless} 11 Hz is referred to further diagnosis), followed by a visual examination of ciliary beat patterns to detect the presence of dyskinetic motions, such as stiff, incomplete, wavy and others. Both procedures lack standardized protocols, hence CBF is often counted manually by observing the ciliary image frames in slow motion, while a manual examination of beat patterns is subjective, cumbersome, and error-prone. We are building automated image analysis methods to address this problem. To this end, we report the use of image velocities for measuring CBF and demonstrate the effectiveness of the differential image velocity invariants, curl and deformation, in deconvolving the various motion defects.},

It has been proved that 1.44/10 000 of all cardiac problems are associated with malformations of left-right asymmetry and heterotaxy accounts for 3\% of all congenital heart defects. It is considered that defects of situs appear due to genetic and environmental factors. Also, there is evidence that the ciliopathies (defects of structure or function) are involved in development abnormalities. Over 100 genes have been reported to be involved in left-right patterning in model organisms, but only a few are likely to candidate for left-right asymmetry defects in humans. Left-right asymmetry disorders are genetically heterogeneous and have variable manifestations (from asymptomatic to serious clinical problems). The discovery of the right mechanism of left-right development will help explain the clinical complexity and may contribute to a therapy of these disorders.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel two-frame motion estimation algorithm. The ﬁrst step is to approximate each neighborhood of both frames by quadratic polynomials, which can be done eﬃciently using the polynomial expansion transform. From observing how an exact polynomial transforms under translation a method to estimate displacement ﬁelds from the polynomial expansion coeﬃcients is derived and after a series of reﬁnements leads to a robust algorithm. Evaluation on the Yosemite sequence shows good results.},
