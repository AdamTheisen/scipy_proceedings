	Abstract = {In recent years, research articles involving molecular dynamics simulations of construction materials have grown significantly in number. The growth reflects an emerging need to understand microscopic physical and chemical processes, which are fundamental to further improve the macroscopic performance of construction materials. Nano-engineering, as a concept about manipulating material structures for creating new materials or modifying existing materials, highly depends on the understanding of materials at the nanoscale, where molecular dynamics simulation becomes an effective and powerful investigation tool. In this paper, the applications of molecular dynamics simulations in understanding the fundamental deformation mechanism of various construction materials including concrete and cement, fiber-reinforced polymers and related bonded systems upon nano-engineering approach are presented. In addition, the study on nature materials towards their structural morphology and functions at the atomistic level is illustrated so as to inspire the future development of advanced construction materials. The challenges and innovations associated with nano-engineering are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {In bionanotechnology, the field of creating functional materials consisting of bio-inspired molecules, the function and shape of a nanostructure only appear through the assembly of many small molecules together. The large number of building blocks required to define a nanostructure combined with the many degrees of freedom in packing small molecules has long precluded molecular simulations, but recent advances in computational hardware as well as software have made classical simulations available to this strongly expanding field. Here, we review the state of the art in simulations of self-assembling bio-inspired supramolecular systems. We will first discuss progress in force fields, simulation protocols and enhanced sampling techniques using recent examples. Secondly, we will focus on efforts to enable the comparison of experimentally accessible observables and computational results. Experimental quantities that can be measured by microscopy, spectroscopy and scattering can be linked to simulation output either directly or indirectly, via quantum mechanical or semi-empirical techniques. Overall, we aim to provide an overview of the various computational approaches to understand not only the molecular architecture of nanostructures, but also the mechanism of their formation.},

	Abstract = {Over the past 25 years, molecular modeling and simulations have provided important
insights into the physics of deformation and fracture of glassy polymers. This review
presents an overview of key results discussed in the context of experimentally observed
polymer behavior. Both atomistic and coarse-grained polymer models have been
used in different deformation protocols to study elastic properties, shear yielding,
creep, physical aging, strain hardening and crazing. Simulations reproduce most of
the macroscopic features of plasticity in polymer glasses such as stress--strain
relations and creep response, and reveal information about the underlying atomistic
processes. Trends of the shear yield stress with loading conditions, temperature
and strain rate, and the atomistic dynamics under load have been systematically
explored. Most polymers undergo physical aging, which leads to a history-dependent
mechanical response. Simulations of strain hardening and crazing demonstrate the
nature of polymer entanglements in the glassy state and the role of local plasticity
and provide insight into the origin of fracture toughness of amorphous polymers.},

	Abstract = { The nucleation of crystals in liquids is one of nature's most ubiquitous phenomena, playing an important role in areas such as climate change and the production of drugs. As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments. },

	Abstract = {A fundamental challenge in biological research is achieving an atomic-level description and mechanistic understanding of the function of biomolecules. Techniques for biomolecular simulations have undergone substantial developments, and their accuracy and scope have expanded considerably. Progress has been made through an increasingly tight integration of experiments and simulations, with experiments being used to refine simulations and simulations used to interpret experiments. Here we review the underpinnings of this progress, including methods for more efficient conformational sampling, accuracy of the physical models used, and theoretical approaches to integrate experiments and simulations. These developments are enabling detailed studies of complex biomolecular assemblies.},

	Abstract = {Analyzing the results of molecular dynamics (MD)-based simulations usually entails extensive manipulations of file formats encoding both the topology (e.g. the chemical connectivity) and configurations (the trajectory) of the simulated system. This chapter reviews a number of software libraries developed to facilitate interactive and batch analysis of MD results with scripts written in high-level, interpreted languages. It provides a beginners' introduction to MD analysis presenting a side-by-side comparison of major scripting languages used in MD, and show how to perform common analysis tasks within the VMD, Bio3D, MDTraj, MDAnalysis and HTMD environments.

	Abstract = {Biomolecular simulation is increasingly central to understanding and designing biological molecules and their interactions. Detailed, physics-based simulation methods are demonstrating rapidly growing impact in areas as diverse as biocatalysis, drug delivery, biomaterials, biotechnology, and drug design. Simulations offer the potential of uniquely detailed, atomic-level insight into mechanisms, dynamics, and processes, as well as increasingly accurate predictions of molecular properties. Simulations can now be used as computational assays of biological activity, for example, in predictions of drug resistance. Methodological and algorithmic developments, combined with advances in computational hardware, are transforming the scope and range of calculations. Different types of methods are required for different types of problem. Accurate methods and extensive simulations promise quantitative comparison with experiments across biochemistry. Atomistic simulations can now access experimentally relevant timescales for large systems, leading to a fertile interplay of experiment and theory and offering unprecedented opportunities for validating and developing models. Coarse-grained methods allow studies on larger length- and timescales, and theoretical developments are bringing electronic structure calculations into new regimes. Multiscale methods are another key focus for development, combining different levels of theory to increase accuracy, aiming to connect chemical and molecular changes to macroscopic observables. In this review, we outline biomolecular simulation methods and highlight examples of its application to investigate questions in biology.

	Abstract = {MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written.  Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X. It is freely available under the GNU Public License from http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com.},

This has been enabled by access to large scale and heterogeneous high performance computing resources, including special purpose hardware. The improved performance of modern simulation methods coupled with hardware advances is shifting the rate-limiting steps of common biomolecular simulations of small- to moderately-sized systems from the generation of data (for example via production molecular dynamics simulations that used to take weeks or even months) to the pre- and post-processing phases of the workflow, namely simulation set-up and data processing, management, and analysis. Access to heterogeneous computational resources enables a broader exploration of biomolecular structure and dynamics by facilitating distinct aspects of typical biomolecular simulation workflows.},

	Abstract = {MDAnalysis (http://mdanalysis.org) is a library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. MD simulations of biological molecules have become an important tool to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure and physiological function. Simulations are performed with highly optimized software packages on HPC resources but most codes generate output trajectories in their own formats so that the development of new trajectory analysis algorithms is confined to specific user communities and widespread adoption and further development is delayed. MDAnalysis addresses this problem by abstracting access to the raw simulation data and presenting a uniform object-oriented Python interface to the user. It thus enables users to rapidly write code that is portable and immediately usable in virtually all biomolecular simulation communities. The user interface and modular design work equally well in complex scripted work flows, as foundations for other packages, and for interactive and rapid prototyping work in IPython / Jupyter notebooks, especially together with molecular visualization provided by nglview and time series analysis with pandas. MDAnalysis is written in Python and Cython and uses NumPy arrays for easy interoperability with the wider scientific Python ecosystem. It is widely used and forms the foundation for more specialized biomolecular simulation tools. MDAnalysis is available under the GNU General Public License v2. },

@inproceedings{Khoshlessan:2017ab,
	Abstract = {The analysis of biomolecular computer simulations has become a challenge because the amount of output data is now routinely in the terabyte range. We evaluated if this challenge can be met by a parallel map-reduce approach with the Dask parallel computing library for task-graph based com- puting coupled with our MDAnalysis Python library for the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We performed a representative performance evalu- ation, taking into account the highly heterogeneous computing environment that researchers typically work in together with the diversity of existing file formats for MD trajectory data. We found that the underlying storage system (solid state drives, parallel file systems, or simple spinning platter disks) can be a deciding performance factor that leads to data ingestion becoming the primary bottleneck in the analysis work flow. However, the choice of the data file format can mitigate the effect of the storage system; in particular, the commonly used Gromacs XTC trajectory format, which is highly compressed, can exhibit strong scaling close to ideal due to trading a decrease in global storage access load against an increase in local per-core CPU-intensive decompression. Scaling was tested on a single node and multiple nodes on national and local supercomputing resources as well as typical workstations. Although very good strong scaling could be achieved for single nodes, good scaling across multiple nodes was hindered by the persistent occurrence of "stragglers", tasks that take much longer than all other tasks, and whose ultimate cause could not be completely ascertained. In summary, we show that, due to the focus on high interoperability in the scientific Python eco system, it is straightforward to implement map-reduce with Dask in MDAnalysis and provide an in-depth analysis of the considerations to obtain good parallel performance on HPC resources.},

	Abstract = {Different frameworks for implementing parallel data analytics applications have been proposed by the HPC and Big Data communities. In this paper, we investigate three frame- works: Spark, Dask and RADICAL-Pilot with respect to their ability to support data analytics requirements on HPC resources. We investigate the data analysis requirements of Molecular Dy- namics (MD) simulations which are significant consumers of su- percomputing cycles, producing immense amounts of data: a typ- ical large-scale MD simulation of physical systems of O(100,000) atoms can produce from O(10) GB to O(1000) GBs of data. We propose and evaluate different approaches for parallelization of a representative set of MD trajectory analysis algorithms, in partic- ular the computation of path similarity and the identification of connected atom. We evaluate Spark, Dask and RADICAL-Pilot with respect to the provided abstractions and runtime engine ca- pabilities to support these algorithms. We provide a conceptual basis for comparing and understanding the different frameworks that enable users to select the optimal system for its application. Further, we provide a quantitative performance analysis of the different algorithms across the three frameworks using different high-performance computing resources.},
