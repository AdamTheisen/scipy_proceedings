Dynamic Social Network Modeling of Diffuse Subcellular Morphologies
-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

The use of fluorescence microscopy has catalyzed new insights into biological
function, and spurred the development of quantitative models from rich biomedical
image datasets. While image processing in some capacity is commonplace for
extracting and modeling quantitative knowledge from biological systems at varying
scales, general-purpose approaches for more advanced modeling are few. In
particular, diffuse organellar morphologies, such as mitochondria or actin
microtubules, have few if any established spatiotemporal modeling strategies,
all but discarding critically important sources of signal from a biological system.
Here, we discuss initial work into building spatiotemporal models of diffuse
subcellular morphologies, using mitochondrial protein patterns of
cervical epithelial (HeLa) cells. We leverage principles of graph theory and
consider the diffuse mitochondrial patterns as a social network: a collection of
vertices interconnected by weighted and directed edges, indicating spatial
relationships. By studying the changing topology of the social networks over
time, we gain a mechanistic understanding of the types of stresses imposed on
the mitochondria by external stimuli, and can relate these effects in terms of
graph theoretic quantities such as centrality, connectivity, and flow. We
demonstrate how the mitochondrial pattern can be faithfully represented
parametrically using a learned mixture of Gaussians, which is then perturbed
to match the spatiotemporal evolution of the mitochondrial patterns over time.
The learned Gaussian components can then be converted to graph Laplacians,
formally defining a network, and the changes in the topology of the Laplacians
can yield biologically-meaningful interpretations of the evolving morphology.
We hope to leverage these preliminary results to implement a bioimaging
toolbox, using existing open source packages in the scientific Python
ecosystem (SciPy, NumPy, scikit-image, OpenCV), which builds dynamic social
network models from time series fluorescence images of diffuse subcellular
protein patterns. This will enable a direct quantitative comparison of network
structure over time and between cells exposed to different conditions.

Introduction
------------

Given the recent rise of fluorescence microscopy, live cell footage has become much more accessible. This increase in subcellular biomedical imaging data has lead to a heavy analysis of organelles with solid structure. However, the growth in modeling and classification of solid morphologies has created a large and growing gap in our ability to autonomously quantify subcellular structures of diffuse morphology, organelles and proteins like mitochondria and actin.

Being able to not only quantify the structure of a protein, but also it’s change over time using both spatial and temporal covariance, can lead to understanding the protein’s relationship with environmental variables like toxins or bacteriophages. Recently, spatial covariance has been used to quantify gene expression correlation in image like matrices representing sequenced RNA :cite:`Svensson143321`. We look to focus on both spatial and temporal covariance to achieve our goal of protein behavior quantification through the novel employ of social network analogues. A recent study of brain activity used networks to create a quantitative measure of correlated activity in fMRI images which could then easily be clustered :cite:`Drysdale4246`. There are many advantages of using a social network metric to model diffuse structures. It allows for not only the overall form of the morphology to impact the quantitative analysis, but also for the diffuseness property to influence the connectivity of the network. The heavily studied field of social network and graph theory also opens opportunity for a varied analysis of the analogue once it has been modeled.

We have begun by modeling the subcellular patterns of mitochondria in epithelial cells. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, which undergo continual rounds of fission and fusion. These fission and fusion events are important for maintaining proper function and overall mitochondrial health :cite:`ZLN13` :cite:`WT16`. Mitochondrial fission allows for the turnover of damaged and the protection of healthy organelles. Additionally, mitochondrial fusion leads to the mixing of internal contents, which is important for responding to environmental needs :cite:`ZLN13` :cite:`KPSB08`.

The dynamics between fission and fusion creates a spectrum of mitochondrial morphologies. Further, imbalances between fission and fusion events generate phenotypes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction :cite:`ZLN13`. An excess of fission or dearth of fusion events results in fragmented mitochondria. In the fragmented phenotype, the mitochondrial network is fractured, and individual mitochondria exist in small spheres. However, an overabundance of fusion or a lack of fission events generate hyperfused mitochondria. In the hyperfusion phenotype, the mitochondrial network is overconnected, and composed of long interconnected tubules :cite:`CCI08`.

Recently, several bacterial species have been shown to cause mitochondrial perturbations during infection :cite:`SBSRC11`:cite:`FGQR15`. Through social network modeling, we hope to build a more rapid and efficient method for identifying changes in size, shape, and distribution of mitochondria as well as other diffuse organelles.

  An abstract representation of our proposed pipeline. The first frame represents the raw unsegmented image of three cells' proteins. The next frame demonstrates the simultaneous segmentation, as a border is drawn around each cell. The third frame represents a single cell being extracted for analysis using the determined Segmentation. The fourth cell shows a characteristic set of nodes determined by applying a mixture model to the distribution of mitochondrial protein. The final image shows edges added to the nodes to complete the network structure. At this point in the pipeline Network analysis can be applied to the created graph in hopes for meaningful quantitative information. These steps are applied to each frame of video allowing for fully temporal analysis. :label:`fig0`.


Data
----

We have constructed a library of live imaging videos that display the full spectrum of mitochondrial morphologies in HeLa cells, from fragmented to hyperfused. To visualize the mitochondria, HeLa cells were stably transfected with DsRed2-Mito-7 (DsRed2-HeLa), which fluorescently labels mitochondria red (a gift from Michael Davidson, Addgene plasmid #55838). All of our videos were taken using a Nikon A1R Confocal. Cells were kept in an imaging chamber that maintained 37 degrees C and 5% CO2 for the duration of imaging. The resonant scanning head was utilized to capture an image every ten seconds for the length of the video. The resulting  raw videos  have more than 20,000 frames per video. Each frame is of dimensions of 512x512 pixels :ref:`fig1`.

.. figure:: morpho.png

   Sample frames from each of the subsets of data. Left) LLO induced mitochondrial fragmentation Center) Wild type HeLa mitochondrial morphology Right) Mdivi-1 induced mitochondrial hyperfusion :label:`fig1`

Wild type mitochondrial morphology was captured by imaging DsRed2-HeLa cells in typical growth medium (DMEM plus 10 % fetal bovine serum)(:ref:`fig1`, center). To generate the fragmented phenotype, cells were exposed to the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) at a final concentration of 6 nM (:ref:`fig1`, left). Mitochondrial hyperfusion was induced through the addition of mitochondria division inhibitor-1 (mdivi-1) at a final concentration of 50µM (:ref:`fig1`, right). These subsets with different known qualitative phenotypes serve as bases upon which to condition our quantitative analyses.

Segmentation Pipeline
---------------------

While our initial input videos contain a range of cell quantities, in order for our analysis to be unbiased to the number of cells in a frame, we chose to study each cell individually. To do that we need to segment each cell. While segmentation of fluorescence microscopy images is becoming very common, this dataset has the added difficulty of the diffuse nature of the mitochondrial protein. Considering the fact that we have minimal movement between consecutive frames, we can use deformable contours with slight changes from the previous frame to build out masks. However, the diffuse structure combined with the near overlap of cells in frames makes the first mask difficult to generate autonomously. Thus, our first step, was to use ITK-SNAP software to label each cell manually in the first frame of each video. The output of this step will be VTK file (:ref:`fig2` top left).

.. figure:: seg.png

   Diagram Representing segmentation process. (Top left) Hand drawn masks of the first frame in VTK format which are used to seed the segmentation. (Top right) a series of frames from a single video with autonomously drawn contours. (Mid) Stack of frames from a single video converted to separate videos for each cell. (Bottom) single cell video unraveled as grayscale image for frame by frame network modeling. :label:`fig2`

Our segmentation process uses this VTK as a seed, then deforms the mask through an iterative dilation, thresholding, and contour detection process over the entire video resulting in a set of masks for each frame. These masks can then be used to pull out single cells over the course of the video (:ref:`fig2`). While this process was very effective at following the cells which diminished in size, we occasionally would find our model losing small discrete areas of protein mass which diverged from the more contiguous structure. To avoid this loss we added a final process of iterative dilation to prevent loss and give a more generous contour. With these adjustments, we ran into a rare problem of cell contact or overlap. In response we continued the iterative dilation with more iterations and smaller dilations checking for overlap each iteration. In the case of an overlap, which would only be a few pixels with the small dilation kernel, we used a simple xor to remove the few overlapping pixels while still allowing the mask to expand in areas uncontested by other cells. With this case being rare, we found the process more often than not followed any visible boundary between the adjacent cell.

Once we’d created a series of masks for each cell over each frame we were able to begin engineering the social network topology to create quantitative representations of the protein’s spatial behavior over the time captured in the video.

Social Network Engineering
--------------------------

To quantitatively study the spectrum of mitochondrial morphologies as well as changes between these morphologies, we needed to develop the process by which a social network is created. Our approach was to first determine nodes of our network, then follow with an affinity function to determine connectedness of the formulated nodes.

.. figure:: network1.png

    (left) a 2D probability representation of the intensity of a sample cell. (top right) the Intensity map of the image in a 3D representation. (bottom right) the 3D contour of the same cell. :label:`fig3`

To determine our network’s nodes we viewed each frame of our videos as a normalized surface in three-dimensional euclidean space representing a bivariate probability density function of the protein structure (:ref:`fig3`). In the analogous bivariate probability density function, the pixel intensity represents the probability value of that pixel’s location in the overall protein structure. We then applied a Gaussian Filter to remove artifacts from image capture which may create false spikes in the image. After application of the filter we counted local maxima. We then used the Gaussian Mixture Model from Scikit-Learn to generate clusters over our image (:ref:`fig4`), the number of which was determined by the number of local maxima on the probability density surface. The clusters generated by the gaussian mixture model as a whole approximate the image data while individually serving as discrete regions of the protein clustered by density. Using the mean and covariances of these clusters as nodes in the network allow for the network structure to be learned purely from the protein’s topology.

In order to generate the pdf from our image data and generate our nodes we used the following functions:

    A cell (left) and the nodes (right) as generated by a gaussian mixture model for the first (top) and last (bottom) frames of a video showing a cell fragmented by LLO :label:`fig4`

With the process for determining our nodes laid out all that was left was determining our affinity function. As a quick first best effort we set the weight to the percentage of the straight line connecting each node that is within the area of the node as determined by the component’s covariance (:ref:`fig5`, mid). Our second early effort at determining the connectedness of connections was to set a threshold determined by the spread of a component and those nodes within that spread were considered connected (:ref:`fig5`, left).

However, with our affinity function we wanted the angular spread of the gaussians to have a large impact on the weight of the connection, as opposed to looking just at the euclidean distance between the means. As a result we settled on using the probability of the presence of the mean of Node A in the gaussian describing Node B as our affinity from A to B (:ref:`fig5`, right). This alone results in an asymmetric affinity_matrix, however it could easily be made symmetric by adding the affinity matrix to its transpose.

.. figure:: network3.png

    (Left) A partially connected network with binary connections. (Right) A single node’s weighted connection within a fully connected graph :label:`fig5`

Many well known social networks have asymmetric connections. For example, there are Twitter and Instagram, in which one member may follow another without being followed back. Even Facebook, which has a symmetric ‘friend’ connection has asymmetric weights in terms of how friends interact over the network. From a mitochondria specific biological perspective, there is little behavioral evidence to support an directed or undirected graph structure. However with a cell’s general Brownian behavior, the undirected structure seem more analogous. This element of the our graph analogue’s structure will be more cemented as we analyze the networks created.

To calculate our final affinity we use the following functions, the normpdf includes an implementation of a normal distrobution function due to discrepencies with the scipy.stats.norm implementation:

(bottom) The tables generated from the LLO cell which shows a drastic increase in connectivity over time as the cell fragments. :label:`fig6`


Current Insights and Future Work Discussion
-------------------------------------------

At this point in our work we’ve been able to generate networks defined by affinity tables for a cell exhibiting fragmentation over time and a control cell. What we see with these is an increase in affinity between nodes as the cell becomes more fragmented (:ref:`fig6`). This occurs due to the increase in the spread of the nodes as they fit less the image with a less present topology. We also have the nodes much closer together due to the overall decrease in area of the fragmenting protein. Meanwhile the control cell shows much less variation in the affinity distribution over time.

With these insights we can see that a graph analogue will show the change in the protein’s morphology over time. However before moving directly forward with analyses we want to refine the graph generation process. For our node generation we have begun the implementation of a gaussian mixture model which will include a uniform distribution component to act as a sort of learned threshold to ignore background noise brought into the segmented image during the dilations in the segmentation process, as will as that contained in void areas of the protein. We also want to continue refinement of the affinity function. Both looking at an undirected version of our current function, as well as the possibility of using other metrics such as a Kullback–Leibler divergence between the two nodes. This would naturally create an undirected affinity between node while taking into account the angularity of the gaussians representing the nodes. In moving forward with the network analysis, we want to continue looking at classic network metrics such as connectivity and cliques as well as using algorithms like spectral clustering on the network’s laplacian or a random walk over the network and see if more quantitative measures can characterize the cell’s morphological changes.
