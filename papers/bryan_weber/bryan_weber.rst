UConnRCMPy: Python-based data analysis for Rapid Compression Machines
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

    The ignition delay of a fuel/air mixture is an important quantity in designing combustion
    devices, and these data are also used to validate computational kinetic models for combustion.
    One of the typical experimental devices used to measure the ignition delay is called a Rapid
    Compression Machine (RCM). This work presents UConnRCMPy, an open-source Python package to
    process experimental data from the RCM at the University of Connecticut. Given an experimental
    measurement, UConnRCMPy computes the thermodynamic conditions in the reactor of the RCM during
    an experiment along with the ignition delay. UConnRCMPy relies on several packages from the
    SciPy stack and the broader scientific Python community. UConnRCMPy implements an extensible
    framework, so that alternative experimental data formats can be incorporated easily. In this
    way, UConnRCMPy improves the consistency of RCM data processing and enables reproducible
    analysis of the data.
