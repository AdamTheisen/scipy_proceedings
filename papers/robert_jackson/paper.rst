A Numerical Perspective to Terraforming a Desert
------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   A short version of the long version that is way too long to be written as a
   short version anyway.  Still, when considering the facts from first
   principles, we find that the outcomes of this introspective approach is
   compatible with the guidelines previously established.

   In such an experiment it is then clear that the potential for further
   development not only depends on previous relationships found but also on
   connections made during exploitation of this novel new experimental
   protocol.

Introduction
------------

   Wind measurements

   (Paragraph about methods used for wind retrievals)

   Currently existing software for wind retrievals includes software based
   off of the strong constraint technique such as CEDRIC (citation) as well
   as software based off of the weak variational technique such as MultiDop
   :cite:`Langetal2017`. Since CEDRIC is based off of a strong constraint
   on the mass continuity equation, the addition of constraints from other
   data sources is not possible with CEDRIC. Also, while CEDRIC was
   re
   However, CEDRIC is difficult to use as it uses a
   scripting language as inputs for the retrieval. While MultiDop is based
   off of the more customizable 3D variational technique, it is fixed to 2 or
   3 radars and is not scalable. In addition, the addition of constraints
   from other 3D fields such as models is not supported and the code is not
   threadsafe.

   The limitations in current wind retrieval software motivated development
   an open source, entirely Pythonic wind retrieval package called PyDDA.
   PyDDA is based entirely on the scientific Python ecosystem. This therefore
   permits the easy installation of PyDDA using pip or anaconda. As will
   be shown later, PyDDA can retrieve winds from multiple radars combined with
   data from model reanalyses with just a few lines of code.

Three dimensional variational technique
---------------------------------------

   The technique that PyDDA uses to create a wind retrieval is based off of
   the optimization of a cost function :math:`J(\vec{v})`. This cost function
   is the weighted sum of many different cost functions related to various
   constraints.

   +-----------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Cost function         | Basis of constraint           |
   +=======================+===============================+
   | :math:`J_{o}(\vec{v})`| Radar observations            |
   +-----------------------+-------------------------------+
   | :math:`J_{c}(\vec{v})`| Mass continuity equation      |
   +-----------------------+-------------------------------+
   | :math:`J_{v}(\vec{v})`| Vertical vorticity equation   |
   +-----------------------+-------------------------------+
   | :math:`J_{m}(\vec{v})`| Model field constraint        |
   +-----------------------+-------------------------------+
   | :math:`J_{b}(\vec{v})`| Background constraint         |
   |                       | (rawinsonde data)             |
   +-----------------------+-------------------------------+
   | :math:`J_{s}(\vec{v})`| Smoothness constraint         |
   +-----------------------+-------------------------------+

   The detailed formulas behind these cost functions can be found in
   :cite:`Shapiroetal2009` and :cite:`Potvinetal2012`

Bibliographies, citations and block quotes
------------------------------------------

If you want to include a ``.bib`` file, do so above by placing  :code:`:bibliography: yourFilenameWithoutExtension` as above (replacing ``mybib``) for a file named :code:`yourFilenameWithoutExtension.bib` after removing the ``.bib`` extension. 

**Do not include any special characters that need to be escaped or any spaces in the bib-file's name**. Doing so makes bibTeX cranky, & the rst to LaTeX+bibTeX transform won't work. 

To reference citations contained in that bibliography use the :code:`:cite:`citation-key`` role, as in :cite:`hume48` (which literally is :code:`:cite:`hume48`` in accordance with the ``hume48`` cite-key in the associated ``mybib.bib`` file).

However, if you use a bibtex file, this will overwrite any manually written references. 

So what would previously have registered as a in text reference ``[Atr03]_`` for 

:: 

     [Atr03] P. Atreides. *How to catch a sandworm*,
           Transactions on Terraforming, 21(3):261-300, August 2003.

what you actually see will be an empty reference rendered as **[?]**.

E.g., [Atr03]_.


If you wish to have a block quote, you can just indent the text, as in 

    When it is asked, What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication. :cite:`hume48`

Dois in bibliographies
++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to include a doi in your bibliography, add the doi to your bibliography
entry as a string. For example:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @Book{hume48,
     author =  "David Hume",
     year =    "1748",
     title =   "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
     address =     "Indianapolis, IN",
     publisher =   "Hackett",
     doi = "10.1017/CBO9780511808432",
   }


If there are errors when adding it due to non-alphanumeric characters, see if
wrapping the doi in ``\detokenize`` works to solve the issue.

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @Book{hume48,
     author =  "David Hume",
     year =    "1748",
     title =   "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
     address =     "Indianapolis, IN",
     publisher =   "Hackett",
     doi = \detokenize{10.1017/CBO9780511808432},
   }

Source code examples
--------------------

Of course, no paper would be complete without some source code.  Without
highlighting, it would look like this::

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

With code-highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

Maybe also in another language, and with line numbers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int main() {
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           /* do something */
       }
       return 0;
   }

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:
   :linenostart: 2

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       /* do something */
   }
 
Important Part
--------------

It is well known [Atr03]_ that Spice grows on the planet Dune.  Test
some maths, for example :math:`e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta`.  Or maybe an
equation on a separate line:

.. math::

   g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx

or on multiple, aligned lines:

.. math::
   :type: eqnarray

   g(x) &=& \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
        &=& \ldots

The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

.. math::
   :label: circarea

   A(r) = \pi r^2.

.. math::
   :label: spherevol

   V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

We can then refer back to Equation (:ref:`circarea`) or
(:ref:`spherevol`) later.

.. figure:: figure1.png

   This is the caption. :label:`egfig`

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: w

   This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
   center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
   bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
   Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
   reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
   have to play with it. :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you reference auto-numbered
figures.

We show the different quantities of materials required in Table
:ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

   \setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table.
   :class: w

   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+
   | This   | is |  a   | very | very | wide | table  |
   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+

Unfortunately, restructuredtext can be picky about tables, so if it simply
won't work try raw LaTeX:


.. raw:: latex

   \begin{table*}

     \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
     \hline
     \multirow{2}{*}{Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Area in square miles}\tabularnewline
     \cline{2-4}
      & Large Horizontal Area & Large Vertical Area & Smaller Square Area\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Albers Equal Area  & 7,498.7 & 10,847.3 & 35.8\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Web Mercator & 13,410.0 & 18,271.4 & 63.0\tabularnewline
