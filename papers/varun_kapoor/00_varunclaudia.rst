Cell Tracking in 3D using deep learning segmentations
------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

Biological cells can be highly irregular in shape and move across planes making it difficult to be detect and track them in 3D with high level of accuracy. In order to solve the detection problem of such cells we use deep learning based segmentations which can reliably segment oddly and differently shaped cells in the same image in 3D. We created SmartSeeds algorithm todo instance segmentation of oddly shaped cells in 3D and provide jupyter notebooks for training and applying model prediction with different use cases.We also present an open source tool that can use used for tracking such cells using customised cost function to solve linear assignment problem and Jaqman linker for linking the tracks of dividing and merging cells. The tool is available as a Fiji plugin and post analysis of tracks is a python and Napari based plugin for plotting relevant information coming out of the tracks.

   segmentation, tracking, deep learning, irregular shaped cells

Introduction
------------
Studying the dynamics of biological cells is key to understanding key biological questions. Such questions involve imaging the cells under different conditions, tracking their development over time and extracting relevant dynamical parameters such as cell intensity variation, cell size change, cell velocity, cell to tissue boundary distance change over time etc. Imaging conditions can be highly variable and have different sources of noise which degrades the quality of the image and with the increasing size of the data acquired using these microscopes it is imperative to have automated algorithms to enable their quantification. Such analysis requires reliable segmentation of cells followed by tracking software to track their motion and finally a track analysis software to extract the relevant information. In out work we develop a technique to segment cells if irregular shape in 3D including the cells that are very faint in their intensity signal. We use a combination of deep learning and computer vision techniques and by using a combination of these two we obtain a parameter free segmentation dependent only on the quality of the training data. 



Of course, no paper would be complete without some source code.  Without
highlighting, it would look like this::

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

With code-highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

Maybe also in another language, and with line numbers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int main() {
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           /* do something */
       }
       return 0;
   }

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:
   :linenostart: 2

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       /* do something */
   }
   
Inline code looks like this: :code:`chunk of code`.

Important Part
--------------

It is well known [Atr03]_ that Spice grows on the planet Dune.  Test
some maths, for example :math:`e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta`.  Or maybe an
equation on a separate line:

.. math::

   g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx

or on multiple, aligned lines:

.. math::
   :type: eqnarray

   g(x) &=& \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
        &=& \ldots

The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

.. math::
   :label: circarea

   A(r) = \pi r^2.

.. math::
   :label: spherevol

   V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

We can then refer back to Equation (:ref:`circarea`) or
(:ref:`spherevol`) later.

.. figure:: figure1.png

   This is the caption.:code:`chunk of code` inside of it. :label:`egfig` 

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: w

   This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
   center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).
   This caption also has :code:`chunk of code`.

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
   bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
   Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
   reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
   have to play with it.  :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you reference auto-numbered
figures.

.. table:: This is the caption for the materials table. :label:`mtable`

   +------------+----------------+
   | Material   | Units          |
   +============+================+
   | Stone      | 3              |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Water      | 12             |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Cement     | :math:`\alpha` |
   +------------+----------------+


We show the different quantities of materials required in Table
:ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

   \setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table.
   :class: w

   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+
   | This   | is |  a   | very | very | wide | table  |
   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+

Unfortunately, restructuredtext can be picky about tables, so if it simply
won't work try raw LaTeX:


.. raw:: latex

   \begin{table*}

     \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
     \hline
     \multirow{2}{*}{Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Area in square miles}\tabularnewline
     \cline{2-4}
      & Large Horizontal Area & Large Vertical Area & Smaller Square Area\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Albers Equal Area  & 7,498.7 & 10,847.3 & 35.8\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Web Mercator & 13,410.0 & 18,271.4 & 63.0\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Difference & 5,911.3 & 7,424.1 & 27.2\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Percent Difference & 44\% & 41\% & 43\%\tabularnewline
     \hline
     \end{longtable*}

     \caption{Area Comparisons \DUrole{label}{quanitities-table}}

   \end{table*}
