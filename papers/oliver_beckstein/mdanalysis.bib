	Year = {2008},
	Abstract = {As parallel algorithms and architectures drive the longest molecular dynamics (MD) simulations towards the millisecond scale, traditional sequential post-simulation data analysis methods are becoming increasingly untenable. Inspired by the programming interface of Google's MapReduce, we have built a new parallel analysis framework called HiMach, which allows users to write trajectory analysis programs sequentially, and carries out the parallel execution of the programs automatically. We introduce (1) a new MD trajectory data analysis model that is amenable to parallel processing, (2) a new interface for defining trajectories to be analyzed, (3) a novel method to make use of an existing sequential analysis tool called VMD, and (4) an extension to the original MapReduce model to support multiple rounds of analysis. Performance evaluations on up to 512 cores demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the HiMach framework on a Linux cluster.},

Encapsulation and polymorphism are used to simultaneously provide a stable interface to the programmer and make LOOS easily extensible. A rich atom selection language based on the C expression syntax is included as part of the library. LOOS enables students and casual programmer- scientists to rapidly write their own analytical tools in a compact and expressive manner resembling scripting. LOOS is written in C++ and makes extensive use of the Standard Template Library and Boost, and is freely available under the GNU General Public License (version 3) (http://loos.sourceforge.net). LOOS has been tested on Linux and MacOS X, but is written to be portable and should work on most Unix-based platforms.},

	Abstract = { We describe PTRAJ and its successor CPPTRAJ, two complementary, portable, and freely available computer programs for the analysis and processing of time series of three-dimensional atomic positions (i.e., coordinate trajectories) and the data therein derived. Common tools include the ability to manipulate the data to convert among trajectory formats, process groups of trajectories generated with ensemble methods (e.g., replica exchange molecular dynamics), image with periodic boundary conditions, create average structures, strip subsets of the system, and perform calculations such as RMS fitting, measuring distances, B-factors, radii of gyration, radial distribution functions, and time correlations, among other actions and analyses. Both the PTRAJ and CPPTRAJ programs and source code are freely available under the GNU General Public License version 3 and are currently distributed within the AmberTools 12 suite of support programs that make up part of the Amber package of computer programs (see http://ambermd.org ). This overview describes the general design, features, and history of these two programs, as well as algorithmic improvements and new features available in CPPTRAJ. },

We have developed MDTraj, a modern, lightweight, and fast software package for analyzing \{MD\} simulations. \{MDTraj\} reads and writes trajectory data in a wide variety of commonly used formats. It provides a large number of trajectory analysis capabilities including minimal root-mean-square-deviation calculations, secondary structure assignment, and the extraction of common order parameters. The package has a strong focus on interoperability with the wider scientific Python ecosystem, bridging the gap between \{MD\} data and the rapidly growing collection of industry-standard statistical analysis and visualization tools in Python. \{MDTraj\} is a powerful and user-friendly software package that simplifies the analysis of \{MD\} data and connects these datasets with the modern interactive data science software ecosystem in Python. },

	Abstract = {Analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories is becoming more and more challenging with simulation times routinely exceeding microseconds (with millions of frames) and increasing in size (with millions of particles). The MDAnalysis library (http://mdanalysis.org) is a versatile open source package that provides a foundation for analysing trajectories, with a particular emphasis on biomolecular simulations. In order to improve MDAnalysis for large simulations, we developed a set of non-trivial benchmarking systems of variable sizes. We generated a modular library of lipid vesicles with the coarse-grained Dry Martini force field, ranging in size from 10 nm to 30 nm radius. These vesicles can be combined in larger multi-vesicle systems in order to produce a range of benchmark systems with variable particle numbers. The systems will also allow us to address the question under which conditions vesicles fuse. We generated simulation systems with up to six vesicles and 3.5 million particles and performed initial simulations on local computing resources. We benchmarked the performance of MDAnalysis to load and process large systems. Our trajectory data set and benchmarking results will be useful to guide future development of MDAnalysis and its integration with the SPIDAL library.},

Biopython now contains a parser for PDB files that makes the atomic information available in an easy-to-use but powerful data structure. The parser and data structure deal with features that are often left out or handled inadequately by other packages, e.g. atom and residue disorder (if point mutants are present in the crystal), anisotropic B factors, multiple models and insertion codes. In addition, the parser performs some sanity checking to detect obvious errors.

	Abstract = {Abstract ProtoMD is a toolkit that facilitates the development of algorithms for multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is designed for multiscale methods which capture the dynamic transfer of information across multiple spatial scales, such as the atomic to the mesoscopic scale, via coevolving microscopic and coarse-grained (CG) variables. ProtoMD can be also be used to calibrate parameters needed in traditional CG-MD methods. The toolkit integrates `GROMACS wrapper' to initiate \{MD\} simulations, and `MDAnalysis' to analyze and manipulate trajectory files. It facilitates experimentation with a spectrum of coarse-grained variables, prototyping rare events (such as chemical reactions), or simulating nanocharacterization experiments such as terahertz spectroscopy, AFM, nanopore, and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. ProtoMD is written in python and is freely available under the \{GNU\} General Public License from github.com/CTCNano/proto_md.

Computer: x86/x86 64. Operating system: Linux. RAM: Depends on the size of the system being simulated and duration of the simulation (few \{MBs\} to TBs) Classification: 3, 4.12, 16.9, 23. External routines: \{GROMACS\} (tested with versions 4.6x and 5.0x), MDAnalysis, GromacsWrapper, numpy, scipy, \{MPI\} Nature of problem: Prototyping multiscale coarse-grained algorithms for molecular dynamics. Solution method: Combining the open-source \{GROMACS\} molecular dynamics package and the python-based \{MDAnalysis\} library for running, debugging, and analyzing multiscale simulations Restrictions: The system under study must be characterized by a clear separation of timescales; otherwise, the multiscale algorithm fails to capture the slowly-varying modes. Running time: Depending on the problem size, simulations can take few hours to months. },

	Abstract = {<p>There is increasing evidence that protein dynamics and conformational changes can play an important role in modulating biological function. As a result, experimental and computational methods are being developed, often synergistically, to study the dynamical heterogeneity of a protein or other macromolecules in solution. Thus, methods such as molecular dynamics simulations or ensemble refinement approaches have provided conformational ensembles that can be used to understand protein function and biophysics. These developments have in turn created a need for algorithms and software that can be used to compare structural ensembles in the same way as the root-mean-square-deviation is often used to compare static structures. Although a few such approaches have been proposed, these can be difficult to implement efficiently, hindering a broader applications and further developments. Here, we present an easily accessible software toolkit, called ENCORE, which can be used to compare conformational ensembles generated either from simulations alone or synergistically with experiments. ENCORE implements three previously described methods for ensemble comparison, that each can be used to quantify the similarity between conformational ensembles by estimating the overlap between the probability distributions that underlie them. We demonstrate the kinds of insights that can be obtained by providing examples of three typical use-cases: comparing ensembles generated with different molecular force fields, assessing convergence in molecular simulations, and calculating differences and similarities in structural ensembles refined with various sources of experimental data. We also demonstrate efficient computational scaling for typical analyses, and robustness against both the size and sampling of the ensembles. ENCORE is freely available and extendable, integrates with the established MDAnalysis software package, reads ensemble data in many common formats, and can work with large trajectory files.</p>},

	Abstract = {Diverse classes of proteins function through large-scale conformational changes and vari- ous sophisticated computational algorithms have been proposed to enhance sampling of these macromolecular transition paths. Because such paths are curves in a high-dimen- sional space, it has been difficult to quantitatively compare multiple paths, a necessary pre- requisite to, for instance, assess the quality of different algorithms. We introduce a method named Path Similarity Analysis (PSA) that enables us to quantify the similarity between two arbitrary paths and extract the atomic-scale determinants responsible for their differences. PSA utilizes the full information available in 3N-dimensional configuration space trajectories by employing the Hausdorff or Fr{\'e}chet metrics (adopted from computational geometry) to quantify the degree of similarity between piecewise-linear curves. It thus completely avoids relying on projections into low dimensional spaces, as used in traditional approaches. To elucidate the principles of PSA, we quantified the effect of path roughness induced by ther- mal fluctuations using a toy model system. Using, as an example, the closed-to-open transi- tions of the enzyme adenylate kinase (AdK) in its substrate-free form, we compared a range of protein transition path-generating algorithms. Molecular dynamics-based dynamic impor- tance sampling (DIMS) MD and targeted MD (TMD) and the purely geometric FRODA (Framework Rigidity Optimized Dynamics Algorithm) were tested along with seven other methods publicly available on servers, including several based on the popular elastic net- work model (ENM). PSA with clustering revealed that paths produced by a given method are more similar to each other than to those from another method and, for instance, that the ENM-based methods produced relatively similar paths. PSA applied to ensembles of DIMS MD and FRODA trajectories of the conformational transition of diphtheria toxin, a particu- larly challenging example, showed that the geometry-based FRODA occasionally sampled the pathway space of force field-based DIMS MD. For the AdK transition, the new concept of a Hausdorff-pair map enabled us to extract the molecular structural determinants respon- sible for differences in pathways, namely a set of conserved salt bridges whose charge- charge interactions are fully modelled in DIMS MD but not in FRODA. PSA has the potential to enhance our understanding of transition path sampling methods, validate them, and to provide a new approach to analyzing conformational transitions.

<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Many proteins are nanomachines that perform mechanical or chemical work by changing their three-dimensional shape and cycle between multiple conformational states. Computer simulations of such conformational transitions provide mechanistic insights into protein function but such simulations have been challenging. In particular, it is not clear how to quantitatively compare current simulation methods or to assess their accuracy. To that end, we present a general and flexible computational framework for quantifying transition paths---by measuring mutual geometric similarity---that, compared with existing approaches, requires minimal a-priori assumptions and can take advantage of full atomic detail alongside heuristic information derived from intuition. Using our <italic>Path Similarity Analysis</italic> (PSA) framework in parallel with several existing quantitative approaches, we examine transitions generated for a toy model of a transition and two biological systems, the enzyme adenylate kinase and diphtheria toxin. Our results show that PSA enables the quantitative comparison of different path sampling methods and aids the identification of potentially important atomistic motions by exploiting geometric information in transition paths. The method has the potential to enhance our understanding of transition path sampling methods, validate them, and to provide a new approach to analyzing macromolecular conformational transitions.</p>},

It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written.  Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands.

Traditional algorithms involve the inversion or decomposi- tion of a 3 3 3or4 3 4 matrix, which can be computationally expensive and numerically unstable in certain cases. Here, we present a simple and robust algorithm to rapidly determine the optimal rotation using a Newton-Raphson quaternion-based method and an adjoint matrix. Our method is at least an order of magnitude more efficient than conventional inversion/decomposition methods, and it should be particularly useful for high-throughput analyses of molecular conformations},

	Abstract = {The recent availability of long equilibrium simulations of protein folding in atomistic detail for more than 10 proteins allows us to identify the key interactions driving folding. We find that the collective fraction of native amino acid contacts, Q, captures remarkably well the transition states for all the proteins with a folding free energy barrier. Going beyond this global picture, we devise two different measures to quantify the importance of individual interresidue contacts in the folding mechanism: (i) the log-ratio of lifetimes of contacts during folding transition paths and in the unfolded state and (ii) a Bayesian measure of how predictive the formation of each contact is for being on a transition path. Both of these measures indicate that native, or near-native, contacts are important for determining mechanism, as might be expected. More remarkably, however, we found that for almost all the proteins, with the designed protein $\alpha$3D being a notable exception, nonnative contacts play no significant part in determining folding mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {The non-linear problem of simulating the structural transition between two known forms of a macromolecule still remains a challenge in structural biology. The problem is usually addressed in an approximate way using 'morphing' techniques, which are linear interpolations of either the Cartesian or the internal coordinates between the initial and end states, followed by energy minimization. Here we describe a web tool that implements a new method to calculate the most probable trajectory that is exact for harmonic potentials; as an illustration of the method, the classical Calpha-based Elastic Network Model (ENM) is used both for the initial and the final states but other variants of the ENM are also possible. The Langevin equation under this potential is solved analytically using the Onsager and Machlup action minimization formalism on each side of the transition, thus replacing the original non-linear problem by a pair of linear differential equations joined by a non-linear boundary matching condition. The crossover between the two multidimensional energy curves around each state is found numerically using an iterative approach, producing the most probable trajectory and fully characterizing the transition state and its energy. Jobs calculating such trajectories can be submitted on-line at: http://lorentz.dynstr.pasteur.fr/joel/index.php.},

	Abstract = {The detailed organization of cellular membranes remains rather elusive. Based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a high-resolution view of the lipid organization of a plasma membrane at an unprecedented level of complexity. Our plasma membrane model consists of 63 different lipid species, combining 14 types of headgroups and 11 types of tails asymmetrically distributed across the two leaflets, closely mimicking an idealized mammalian plasma membrane. We observe an enrichment of cholesterol in the outer leaflet and a general non-ideal lateral mixing of the different lipid species. Transient domains with liquid-ordered character form and disappear on the microsecond time scale. These domains are coupled across the two membrane leaflets. In the outer leaflet, distinct nanodomains consisting of gangliosides are observed. Phosphoinositides show preferential clustering in the inner leaflet. Our data provide a key view on the lateral organization of lipids in one of life's fundamental structures, the cell membrane.},

	Abstract = {Adenylate kinase (AdK), a phosphotransferase enzyme, plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis. It undergoes a large conformational change between an open and a closed state, even in the absence of substrate. We investigate the apo-AdK transition at the atomic level both with free-energy calculations and with our new dynamic importance sampling (DIMS) molecular dynamics method. DIMS is shown to sample biologically relevant conformations as verified by comparing an ensemble of hundreds of DIMS transitions to AdK crystal structure intermediates. The simulations reveal in atomic detail how hinge regions partially and intermittently unfold during the transition. Conserved salt bridges are seen to have important structural and dynamic roles; in particular, four ionic bonds that open in a sequential, zipper-like fashion and, thus, dominate the free-energy landscape of the transition are identified. Transitions between the closed and open conformations only have to overcome moderate free-energy barriers. Unexpectedly, the closed state and the open state encompass broad free-energy basins that contain conformations differing in domain hinge motions by up to 40??. The significance of these extended states is discussed in relation to recent experimental F??rster resonance energy transfer measurements. Taken together, these results demonstrate how a small number of cooperative key interactions can shape the overall dynamics of an enzyme and suggest an "all-or-nothing" mechanism for the opening and closing of AdK. Our efficient DIMS molecular dynamics computer simulation approach can provide a detailed picture of a functionally important macromolecular transition and thus help to interpret and suggest experiments to probe the conformational landscape of dynamic proteins such as AdK. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
