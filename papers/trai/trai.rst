CNN Based ToF Image Processing
------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   ...followed by a real life application using artificial intelligence to estimate the human body pose 
   for applications such as gesture recognition, movement direction estimation or physical exercises monitoring. 
   The entire human pose estimation application implementation flow is described, from generating and training the pose estimation 
   AI model using Keras and TensorRT to deploying and running live on an Nvidia Xavier NX platform receiving data from an Analog Devices ToF camera.

.. class:: keywords

Introduction
------------

Last years the evolution of CNN also affected the way in which the ToF specific images are processed...
