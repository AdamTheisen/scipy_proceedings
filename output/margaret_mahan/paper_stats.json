The assessment of functional connectivity relies, in turn, on the proper calculation of interactions between neural time series, which is achieved by rendering each individual series stationary and nonautocorrelated (i.e. white noise -> “prewhiten” the series). This ensures that the functional connectivities computed subsequently are due to the interactions between the series and do not reflect internal dependencies of the series themselves. An established method for prewhitening time series is to apply an AutoRegressive (AR, p) Integrative (I, d) Moving Average (MA, q) model (ARIMA) and retain the residuals. To diagnostically check whether the model orders (p, d, q) are sufficient, both visualization (ACF \\& PACF plots) and tests (Ljung-Box, KPSS, etc.) of the residuals are performed. However, these tests are not robust for high-order models in long time series. Additionally, as dataset size increases (i.e. number of time series to model) it’s not feasible to visually inspect each series independently. As a result, there is a need for robust alternatives to diagnostic evaluations of ARIMA modeling. In this presentation, we demonstrate how to perform ARIMA modeling of long time series using Statsmodels. For this process, we implemented all methods and solvers for parameter estimation and identified a set of fit parameters for which the long time series were modeled appropriately, as compared to known statistical packages. Then, we present a new algorithm to test the hypothesis that a prewhitened series does not differ significantly from white noise. This test was validated using three datasets: (1) magnetoencephalography recordings, (2) multielectrode arrays, and (3) simulations. Overall, the white noise test presented here provides a robust alternative to diagnostic checks of ARIMA modeling for long time series.
