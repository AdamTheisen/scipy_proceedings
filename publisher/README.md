# For editors publishing the proceedings.

There are three different modes for publishing the proceedings, you will need to
set the mode inside the `publisher/conf.py` file under the `status_file_base`
value. The main use of this feature is to make it easier to switch from "draft"
the default to a "conference ready" or "ready" version of the proceedings that
can be served on the official SciPy organisation website. 

- "draft": (default)
  The draft mode of the proceedings.
  This should be kept as the value in the living repository.
- "conference":
  This is the mode of the proceedings that can be published in time for the 
  conference itself. The watermark is lighter and it indicates that only small
  changes will be applied (e.g., adding video links once they are posted)
- "ready":
  This is the version of the proceedings with no watermark. This should only
  be used to publish the final version of the proceedings.
